                <p>This is one of my first, full scale projects (using version control, a database, multiple editors, ect...) I did in my years in undergrad at the University of Washington (Bothell).
                The goal was to create a Python script (in Jupyter Notebooks) that could look for and compare different genes
                that were expressed for a microbial sample.</p>
